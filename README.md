This is just a collection of scripts that play with the 3n+1 conjecture. Which is defined as; For all natural numbers n, if n is odd then apply 3n+1, or if n is even then apply 2n.    This creates a sequence which typically ends in a loop of 4,2,1.  With this conjecture I will show an encoding system for strings.
